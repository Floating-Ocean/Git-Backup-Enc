# List of files and directories to backup
# Syntax similar to .gitignore but for inclusion

# *.txt           - all .txt files
# docs/           - entire docs directory
# config.json     - specific file
# *.log           - all log files
# **/*.py         - all Python files in any subdirectory

# Add your patterns below:
